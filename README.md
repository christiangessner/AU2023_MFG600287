# MFG600287 | Data-Driven: Digitally Share CAD Data Throughout the Product Lifecycle

## KEY LEARNING
- Explore what systems can and should be connected.
- Learn about different technologies available for system integrations.
- Explore real-world customer integrations.
- Learn about restrictions and limitations.

## DESCRIPTION
CAD data is the most important intellectual property that a manufacturer has. Autodesk offers products that create, manage, and enrich this data. AutoCAD, Inventor, and Autodesk Fusion 360 software create this data while Vault, Fusion 360 Manage Extension, and Upchain help manage it. The cloud-based Fusion 360 and Autodesk Construction Cloud platforms facilitate collaboration within the field, while Prodsmart helps collaboration within production. Simultaneously, aspects of this data need to be shared with other enterprise systems like ERP. Ultimately, all these systems must be able to share aspects of this data throughout the lifecycle of a manufacturer’s products. We’ll demonstrate, via examples of Autodesk customer projects, how technologies such as Autodesk Platform Services and other third-party technologies make it possible to share this important data between these systems rather than leaving it siloed in different systems.
